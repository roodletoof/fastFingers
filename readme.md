**This program is a single file python script that will test your typing-speed in the terminal.**

Set your preferred settings by changing the relevant constants at the top of the file.

One of the goals I had while making this was for the project to only be a single file.


***To reach that goal I have done the following things:***


- The script updates itself to set a new highscore, so there is no separate save file.


- The list of words is downloaded each time the script runs.
